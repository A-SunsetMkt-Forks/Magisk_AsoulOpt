I'm here to introduce you the greatest thief @tryigitx !  
So, what did he do?  
  
1. He kept stealing FAS-RS module from @shadow3aaa without any permission, and pretended to be co-developed with shadow.  
In fact, he hasn't developed any kind of project, just because he is not able to.  
  
From his homepage (https://linktr.ee/tryigitx), we can see he is an eXpErT! lmfao🤣🤣  
I just can't imagine how can a real expert do these things. If @tryigitx is a real expert, pLeAsE fOrGiVe Me😭😭  
  
2. He also stole other modules, like "Play Integrity Fix".  
He copied it and changed the author to his own, but that's not all.  
  
Maybe it's some kind of self-deception, he also changed the name to "China Play Integrity Fix".  
He seemed to want to express that this is for China Version ROMs, but everyone can see what he really wanted to do.  
  
3. When I joined his group, and asked him why he did these, he chose to delete my messages directly.  
Even then, he removed me from the group and blocked me.  
  
I just don’t get what the point of him doing this is, because it can’t hide that he has done these things.  
  
Now that you've all seen these, make your own judgment based on your own values.
